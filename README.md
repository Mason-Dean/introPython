# introPython
A list of intro python projects for practice.


## Projects 
There are in no particular order. Pick one that seems fun.
My recommended steps:

1. Talk through how you would solve the problem by hand
1. Write the steps as comments in your program
1. Write code in those steps 
1. If you're writing the same code over and over, make it a function

**Google and Stackoverflow are your friends.**

### Math challenges

* Is the number prime
* Is the number a fibonacci
* Guess the number 
    * The user picks a number within a range (1-100). The computer makes guesses and the users tells the computer if the guess is correct, too high, or too low. Design your program so the computer needs the fewest guesses to get the number.
* Making Change
    * The user provides the amount of the bill and the amount recieved. The computer tells the cashier how to make the change using the smallest number of coins.
* Age calculator
    * User provides their birthday and the computer tells them information like the following:
        * How old they are today
        * How long until their next birthday
        * What day of the week their next birthday will be on
        * etc.
